    <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> Hello, welcome to Studyera! Studyera is a classroom-assist tool focused on helping students learn through quizzing and efficient note-taking. On this platform users can create 'learning packages' using our wide array of tools. Anyone can create a package and add questions or notes. A package is essentially a collection of questions, notes, or other learning materials. Packages are public and can be viewed by anyone, however only the owner can edit their own packages. There are 2 main tools available for creating these packages. They include single-word input and multiple choice format. Upon clicking 'Access Tools' you will be able to select which tool you would like to use for your purposes.

      <h5>
       On the home page you can click 'Login' to view your profile. There is a search bar at the top-right to discover packages. After logging in, you can go to your account page and see your packages. You will also be able to create your own packages from your account dashboard. Additionally you can 'create a room' - that essentially allows you to create study groups with others so you can learn various packages which will foster important study habits. Users are able to create rooms and then add packages as well as invite other users. Rooms offer shared note-taking features as well as a more competitive quizzing environment. There is a 'live challenge' feature as well which is accessible to all users, where you can invite people you want to compete with in time-based quiz challenges. Questions for the live challenge would be selected from packages of your choice.
